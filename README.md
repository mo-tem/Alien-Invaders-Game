# Alien-Invaders-Game

### Task:

Making a fully functional space-invader game called "Alien Invaders".

### Purpose:

Improving my software development, design, and game development skills while building a fun game in the process.

Also adding additional functionalities and refactoring my code for simplicity.

### Languages:

HTML, JavaScript (styling done almost entirely using JavaScript)

### Hosting:

Github Pages

### How To Play:

Move your mouse to move your player and align yourself with an enemy. Then, shoot lasers at the enemy with your space bar to score points. The background music will keep looping unless you press "P" to pause it. You can press "P" again to unpause the music and resume listening to it.

### Live Demo:

### Next Steps / Future Changes:

- Add a "play again" functionality.

- Better color and design for the player, enemy, and background.

- More effects to add during collisions.

- Sound off/on buttons throughout gameplay.

- Game Over sound effect and signal once an alien touches the floor.

- Game Over Screen.

- Celebration for each x10 milestone (level up sound effect, and randomly chosen congratularly image).

- Refactoring to ES6.

- Use the recently added fontawesome library to include relevant icons for play/pause, start screen etc.
