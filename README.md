# Alien-Invaders-Game

### Task:

Making a fully functional space-invader game called "Alien Invaders".

### Purpose:

Improving my software development, design, and game development skills while building a fun game in the process.

Also adding additional functionalities and refactoring my code for simplicity.

### Languages:

HTML, JavaScript (styling done entirely using JavaScript)

### Hosting:

### How To Play:

Move your mouse to move your player and align yourself with an enemy. Then, shoot lasers at the enemy with your space bar to score points.
